        <summary>Task 1 — Model summary (150 words)</summary>
        <p>The chart illustrates the percentage of people using smartphones in Country X between 2005 and 2020. Overall, smartphone ownership rose substantially throughout the period. In 2005 approximately 10% of the population used smartphones; this figure climbed to 35% by 2010 and reached 70% in 2015, before increasing more moderately to 85% in 2020. The most significant growth occurred between 2010 and 2015 when usage nearly doubled. Although growth slowed after 2015, by 2020 a clear majority of the population owned smartphones. This trend suggests rapid adoption during the early 2010s followed by market saturation in the latter half of the period.</p>

        <summary>Task 2 — Sample short essay (band-style)</summary>
        <p>Many believe that unpaid community service should be mandatory in high schools. I partly agree with this view. Introducing service as a required activity can build civic responsibility and give students experience of teamwork and real-world problems. For example, volunteering at local care homes teaches empathy and communication skills, which are useful later in life. However, making it compulsory could disadvantage students who must work part-time or care for family members. A better approach is to offer structured, credited community-service programmes with flexibility or alternatives such as school-based projects. This maintains benefits while accommodating different circumstances. In conclusion, community service is valuable and should be strongly encouraged, but mandatory requirements should include exceptions and flexible options to ensure fairness.</p>
